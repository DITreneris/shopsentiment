# ShopSentiment Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design of the ShopSentiment application, explaining the structure, components, and best practices implemented.

## Application Structure

The application follows a modular architecture to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability:

```

## Key Components

### Application Factory

The application is initialized using an application factory pattern in `src/__init__.py`. This allows for multiple instances of the application to be created with different configurations, particularly useful for testing.

### API Structure

APIs are organized into versioned modules to ensure backward compatibility as the API evolves:

- All endpoints follow the `/api/v1/...` pattern
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes for responses
- Input validation for request parameters

### Data Models

Pydantic models define the data structure and validation rules:

- `Product`: Represents product information with sentiment data
- `Review`: Represents customer reviews with sentiment scores
- `SentimentAnalysis`: Represents sentiment analysis results

### Database Layer

MongoDB integration is implemented through:

- Connection pooling for efficient database access
- Data Access Layer (DAL) for encapsulated data operations
- Proper indexing for performance optimization
- Consistent error handling and logging

### Caching

Redis-based caching is implemented to improve performance:

- API response caching with configurable timeouts
- In-memory fallback when Redis is unavailable
- Cache statistics and monitoring
- Cache invalidation strategies

### Security

Security features include:

- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure cookie configuration
- Content Security Policy headers

## Design Patterns

The application implements several design patterns:

1. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating the Flask application
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Used for database connections
3. **Repository Pattern**: Used for data access layers
4. **Decorator Pattern**: Used for caching and security features
5. **Facade Pattern**: Used for services that simplify complex operations

## Configuration

The application uses a hierarchical configuration system:

- `config/default.py`: Base configuration with default values
- `config/development.py`: Development-specific settings (debugging, logging)
- `config/production.py`: Production-specific settings (security, performance)

Environment-specific settings are loaded based on the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable.

## Error Handling

A consistent error handling approach is implemented throughout:

- Standardized error response format for API endpoints
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Graceful fallbacks for service failures
- User-friendly error pages for web routes

## Performance Considerations

Performance optimizations include:

- Database indexing for common queries
- Response caching for frequently accessed data
- Connection pooling for database access
- Asynchronous operations where appropriate
- Minimal dependencies in critical paths

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvements:

1. Implement a message queue for processing sentiment analysis
2. Add background workers for data processing
3. Implement a more sophisticated caching strategy
4. Add support for A/B testing of sentiment algorithms
5. Implement a full-text search engine for product discovery
