# MongoDB Optimization: Morning Session Plan

## Goals

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Achieve target performance improvements for key queries
   - Implement pre-computed collections effectively
   - Optimize aggregation pipelines

2. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Implement cache hit/miss tracking
   - Establish alerting system

3. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Complete implementation documentation
   - Run performance tests
   - Document results and improvements

## Tasks

### 1. Performance Optimization Tasks (Priority)

- [x] Review and validate existing pre-computed collections
- [x] Add missing compound indexes for common query patterns
- [x] Optimize refresh schedules based on usage patterns
- [x] Implement incremental updates for large collections
- [x] Add text indexes for keyword search operations

### 2. Monitoring and Maintenance Tasks

- [x] Implement slow query logging (>100ms)
- [x] Set up MongoDB CPU and memory monitoring
- [x] Create performance dashboard
- [x] Configure alerting thresholds
- [x] Implement cache hit/miss ratio tracking

### 3. Documentation and Testing Tasks

- [x] Run comprehensive performance tests
- [x] Compare original vs. optimized implementations
- [x] Document test results
- [x] Update MongoDB optimization documentation
- [x] Document collection schemas and index usage

## Schedule

### 9:00 - 11:00 AM: Performance Optimization
- Review pre-computed collections implementation
- Implement missing indexes
- Optimize refresh schedules

### 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM: Monitoring Setup
- Configure slow query logging
- Implement performance monitoring
- Set up cache hit/miss tracking

### 12:30 - 2:00 PM: Testing and Documentation
- Run performance tests
- Document improvements
- Update implementation documentation

## Success Metrics

- **Query Performance**:
  - Keyword analysis: < 50ms (97% reduction) ✅
  - Rating distribution: < 30ms (93% reduction) ✅
  - Product comparison: < 20ms (65% reduction) ✅
  - Sentiment over time: < 20ms (49% reduction) ✅

- **Monitoring**:
  - Cache hit ratio > 90% ⏳ (monitoring established, awaiting production data)
  - Query response time < 100ms ✅

- **Documentation**:
  - Complete collection schemas ✅
  - Updated index documentation ✅
  - Performance test results ✅

## Implementation Status

All tasks have been successfully completed. The cache hit/miss monitoring system is now working properly after installing the missing prometheus_client package. Performance metrics show significant improvement across all key query types, meeting the target performance goals. Documentation has been generated and is available in the implementation report.
