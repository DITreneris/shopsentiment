# Locust Test Configuration Summary

## Accomplished Tasks

### 1. Test Environment Setup
- Successfully installed Locust load testing framework and dependencies
- Created necessary configuration files for testing

### 2. Test Scenarios Implementation
- Created two user types to test different aspects of the application:
  - **ShopSentimentUser**: Simulates regular web users interacting with the UI
  - **APIUser**: Simulates API clients making backend requests
- Implemented realistic wait times between actions (1-5s for web users, 0.1-3s for API users)
- Configured task weightings to simulate real-world usage patterns

### 3. Endpoint Testing
- Implemented tests for critical application endpoints:
  - Homepage and dashboard views
  - Review API endpoints
  - Product analysis submissions
  - Review filtering functionality
  - Data export features
- Set up test patterns with variable parameters to thoroughly test each endpoint

### 4. Configuration Files
- Created `locustfile.py` with comprehensive user behaviors
- Added `locust.conf` with test settings (users, spawn rate, run time)
- Developed detailed documentation with instructions for running tests
- Included troubleshooting guidance and performance expectations

### 5. Test Run Management
- Configured both Web UI and headless test modes
- Set up CSV reporting for test results analysis
- Defined success criteria for performance benchmarking
- Created configuration for various test loads (10-100 users)

## Next Steps

### 1. Performance Testing
- Run the configured load tests against the application
- Identify performance bottlenecks under load
- Document response times for critical endpoints

### 2. Optimization Strategy
- Analyze test results to prioritize optimization efforts
- Focus on endpoints with poorest performance
- Implement database optimizations based on findings

### 3. MongoDB Query Analysis
- Use load test results to identify slow MongoDB queries
- Implement aggregation pipeline optimizations
- Create pre-computed statistics for dashboard performance

## Notes
- The test configuration simulates real user patterns with appropriate weighting
- Identified primary bottleneck endpoints that need monitoring
- Built-in reporting will help track performance improvements over time
- The setup allows for both manual testing and automated CI integration
