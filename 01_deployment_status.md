# ShopSentiment Application Deployment Status

*Updated: April 23, 2025 (Re-evaluation Post-v63)*

## Current Status

☢️ **CRITICAL FEATURE MISSING**: While backend services (DB, Cache, API framework) are stable (v63), the application **DOES NOT** currently implement the core functionality described in the README: collecting/scraping product reviews from external e-commerce platforms. The existing API only allows manual data addition and analysis.
- URL: https://shopsentiment-analysis-1f4b6bb2d702.herokuapp.com/
- Health check: https://shopsentiment-analysis-1f4b6bb2d702.herokuapp.com/health (Backend Services Healthy)
- API Endpoints (Products, Sentiment Analyze): Functional *only* for manually added data.

❌ **Core Functionality Gap**: The description "analyzing sentiment in product reviews across different e-commerce platforms" from the README is **NOT MET** by the current implementation. The scraping/collection mechanism is missing.

## Issues Resolved (Backend Stabilization - v63)

- Core backend services (Database connection, Cache connection) are stable.
- API framework is running without major crashes (async issues resolved).
- Basic API endpoints (`/api/v1/products`, `/api/v1/sentiment/analyze`) function correctly *with manually added data*.

## Issues Requiring Attention

1.  **Implement Review Scraping/Collection**
    - ❌ **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** The mechanism to automatically gather product reviews from external e-commerce platforms (as implied by the README) is missing entirely or non-functional.
    - This is the core value proposition and must be implemented.

2.  **(Lower Priority / Post-Scraping):** Template Rendering, Static Files, Warnings, etc.
    - These are secondary until the core scraping functionality is addressed.

## Plan to Implement Core Scraping Functionality

**Objective:** Implement the capability to collect product reviews from external e-commerce platforms as described in the README.

1.  **Step 1: Locate or Confirm Absence of Scraping Code (Immediate Priority)**
    - Perform a thorough search of the entire codebase for any existing scraping logic (keywords: `scrape`, `fetch`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `Playwright`, e-commerce site names).
    - **Goal:** Determine if *any* scraping code exists that can be fixed or leveraged.

2.  **Step 2: Define Scraping Requirements (If Step 1 yields nothing usable)**
    - Identify target e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon, Best Buy - need USER input).
    - Define data to be extracted (review text, rating, date, user, product identifier).
    - Determine trigger mechanism (API call, scheduled task - need USER input).

3.  **Step 3: Design & Develop Scraper Module (Core Implementation)**
    - Choose appropriate scraping tools/libraries based on target site complexity.
    - Develop parsing logic to extract required data fields accurately.
    - Implement error handling and strategies for dealing with potential anti-scraping measures.

4.  **Step 4: Integrate Scraper with Application**
    - Create necessary API endpoints or background task triggers for the scraper.
    - Connect scraper output to the existing `ProductDAL` to save products and reviews.
    - Ensure scraped data is processed correctly by the sentiment analysis service.

5.  **Step 5: Test & Refine**
    - Test thoroughly against target platforms.
    - Debug parsing errors and refine selectors.
    - Ensure reliability and error handling.

6.  **Step 6: Deploy Working Scraper**
    - Deploy the version with functional review collection.

**Note:** All other tasks (UI improvements, non-critical warnings) are secondary until Step 6 is achieved.

## Lessons Learned

1.  **Module Structure**
    - Complex module hierarchies can cause import issues in different environments.
    - Nested packages with `__init__.py` files can be problematic on some platforms.
    - Absolute imports are more reliable than relative imports for complex structures.

2.  **NLTK Integration**
    - NLTK data download is problematic in serverless environments.
    - Pre-downloading data or providing fallbacks is essential.
    - Environment variables alone may not solve NLTK download issues.

3.  **Heroku Deployment**
    - Heroku's ephemeral filesystem requires special handling for data files.
    - Environment configuration is critical for successful deployment.
    - The buildpack system has limitations for complex Python applications.
    - Build cache can sometimes cause unexpected behavior with stale code.

4.  **Debugging Complex Issues:**
    - Requires iterative steps: form hypothesis, add logging/tests, deploy, analyze results.
    - Errors can occur in unexpected places (e.g., within monitoring endpoints like `/health`).
    - Silent failures require careful logging placement to understand the application's logic flow.

5.  **Local vs. Remote Environment Differences:**
    - `.env` file loading can differ; ensure Flask loads it correctly locally.
    - SSL certificate verification behaves differently locally vs. on Heroku when connecting to remote services (`rediss://`). Local bypasses might be needed, but production requires default verification.
    - Flask extension initialization (e.g., `Flask-Caching.init_app`) can exhibit subtle differences or failures in production environments (Heroku/Gunicorn) that don't appear with the local development server. Debugging requires careful attention to environment-specific configurations and logging.

6.  **Project Alignment:** Critical importance of ensuring development work directly addresses the core requirements and value proposition outlined in project documentation (e.g., README) from the start. Failure to do so leads to wasted effort and frustration.

- Documentation: TBD

## Deployment Notes

The application uses Gunicorn with the following command:
```
web: PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. PYTHON_NLTK_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py wsgi:app
```

Current Python version: 3.10 (specified in `.python-version`)

**Warning:** Heroku deployment logs showed concerns about runtime.txt being deprecated. Consider updating to use .python-version file instead.
