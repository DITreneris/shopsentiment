# ShopSentiment Application Deployment Status

*Updated: April 22, 2025*

## Current Status

❌ **Application NON-FUNCTIONAL**: While the process is running on Heroku, critical issues prevent the application from working correctly.
- URL: https://shopsentiment-analysis-1f4b6bb2d702.herokuapp.com/ (May load, but features reliant on cache will fail)
- Health check: https://shopsentiment-analysis-1f4b6bb2d702.herokuapp.com/health (Currently buggy - see below)
- API health check: https://shopsentiment-analysis-1f4b6bb2d702.herokuapp.com/api/health (Status unknown, likely impacted)

❌ **Critical Issue - Cache Status**: The cache consistently initializes as `SimpleCache` and reports as `unhealthy`. This breaks core functionality.
❌ **Critical Issue - Health Check Bug**: The main `/health` endpoint itself is buggy (`'Cache' object is not subscriptable`), preventing reliable status monitoring.
❌ **API v1 Endpoints**: Status unknown, likely non-functional due to the cache issue. Needs re-verification after cache/health is fixed.

## Issues Resolved

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Fixed the issue with `flask_cors` dependency by making the app factory more resilient to missing modules
   - Added try/except blocks around critical module imports to ensure the app can start even with missing components
   - Added `nltk` and `textblob` dependencies for sentiment analysis functionality

2. **Configuration Loading**
   - Added proper Python package structure to the `config` directory by creating `__init__.py`
   - Created a working `default.py` configuration file with necessary settings
   - Implemented fallback default configuration in the app factory to prevent initialization failures
   - Added error handling around configuration loading to make the app more robust

3. **Missing Route Blueprints**
   - Created the required blueprint files (`src/routes/api.py` and `src/routes/main.py`)
   - Implemented basic functionality including health check endpoints
   - Fixed template directory path configuration

4. **Health Check Endpoint**
   - Added a direct health endpoint to the main app to ensure monitoring can verify application health
   - Implemented API health endpoint for API status verification

5. **Sentiment Service**
   - Fixed the sentiment service initialization by properly exposing the `create_sentiment_service` function in the services package
   - Added proper Python package imports and structure

6. **NLTK Data**
   - ✅ Created an `nltk.txt` file to specify which NLTK data packages to download during Heroku deployment
   - Added required NLTK data packages: punkt, stopwords, vader_lexicon, wordnet, and averaged_perceptron_tagger
   - Verified that the application can now access the required NLTK data for sentiment analysis
   - Health endpoints are now returning "healthy" status showing successful NLTK integration

7. **API v1 Endpoints Registration**
   - ✅ Fixed the API v1 blueprint registration in the `app_factory.py` by using direct blueprint imports
   - Updated the initialization of required dependencies, including creating stub implementations for the MongoDB client
   - Added error handling for import and registration errors with detailed logging
   - Created the missing `sqlite_connection.py` module with the `get_sqlite_db` function
   - Fixed the product routes blueprint to use `before_app_request` instead of `before_app_first_request`
   - Implemented a verification script (`verify_api_routes.py`) to test API routes registration

8. **Environment Variables**
   - ✅ Created a `.env` file with production environment variables
   - Added NLTK-specific environment variables to control download behavior
   - Updated the Heroku Procfile to include proper environment variable configuration

## Recent Changes Made (April 22, 2025 - Cache Debugging Session)

1.  **Build Cache Purge (v49)**
    - Purged Heroku build cache (`heroku repo:purge_cache`) to eliminate potential stale code issues.
    - Redeployed application (v49).
    - Result: Issue persisted; health check still showed `SimpleCache` unhealthy.

2.  **Detailed Cache Factory Logging (v50)**
    - Added detailed `try...except` logging (including traceback) around the Redis connection attempt (`Redis.from_url()` and `.ping()`) in `src/utils/cache_factory.py`.
    - Deployed application (v50).
    - Result: Analysis of startup logs showed **no exception was caught** by the new logging block, yet the application still defaulted to `SimpleCache`.

3.  **Log Analysis & New Finding**
    - Reviewed Heroku logs extensively.
    - Identified a new error originating from the `/health` endpoint itself: `ERROR - Cache health check failed during operation: 'Cache' object is not subscriptable`. This indicates a bug in the health check's interaction with the cache object.

## Issues Requiring Attention

1.  **Cache Initialization Failure**
    - ❌ Despite `REDIS_URL` being correctly set in Heroku config and `config/production.py` specifying `CACHE_TYPE = 'RedisCache'`, the application consistently falls back to `SimpleCache`.
    - The detailed logging added in `v50` did *not* capture an explicit connection error during the `Redis.from_url()` or `ping()` calls, deepening the mystery.
    - The root cause for defaulting to `SimpleCache` remains unidentified.

2.  **Health Check Endpoint Bug**
    - ❌ The `/health` route in `src/__init__.py` crashes internally when checking cache status, reporting `'Cache' object is not subscriptable`.
    - This bug needs fixing to get a reliable status report and potentially unmask other issues.

3.  **API v1 Endpoint Deployment**
    - ❓ Status needs re-verification. The historical `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.services.sentiment_analyzer'` might be resolved, but testing is needed. Potential impact from cache issues.

4.  **NLTK Data Download**
    - ✅ This seems resolved based on previous logs showing NLTK data being available.

5. **Template Rendering**
   - While the app is running, we haven't verified if the template rendering is working correctly
   - Need to test routes that depend on templates (`/`, `/about`, etc.)

6. **Database Connection**
   - The application may require database setup and configuration
   - Check if data access is functioning correctly

7. **Static Files**
   - Verify that static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) are properly served

8. **Runtime Deprecation Warning**
   - Heroku warns that `runtime.txt` is deprecated and should be replaced with `.python-version`
   - Consider updating the Python version specification format

## Next Steps

1.  **Fix Health Check Bug:**
    - **Priority:** High.
    - Modify the `/health` endpoint logic in `src/__init__.py` to correctly interact with the `cache` object (retrieved from `app.extensions['cache']`) and determine its status without causing the `'Cache' object is not subscriptable` error.

2.  **Enhance Cache Factory Logging:**
    - Add logging *before* the `if cache_type == 'RedisCache':` block in `src/utils/cache_factory.py`.
    - Log the values of `cache_type`, `REDIS_AVAILABLE`, and `config.get('CACHE_REDIS_URL')` *as they are seen by the factory function*. This will help verify the conditions leading to the Redis path being taken or skipped.

3.  **Verify Configuration Load:**
    - Double-check that the `config/production.py` is definitely being loaded by Heroku and that `CACHE_TYPE` is correctly set to `'RedisCache'` within the running application environment. Consider adding logging during `load_configuration` in `src/__init__.py`.

4.  **Re-test API v1 Endpoints:**
    - Once the cache and health check issues are stable, systematically test the `/api/v1/...` endpoints again.

5.  **(Lower Priority):** Address other pending checks (Template Rendering, Static Files, Runtime Deprecation Warning).

## Lessons Learned

1.  **Module Structure**
    - Complex module hierarchies can cause import issues in different environments.
    - Nested packages with `__init__.py` files can be problematic on some platforms.
    - Absolute imports are more reliable than relative imports for complex structures.

2.  **NLTK Integration**
    - NLTK data download is problematic in serverless environments.
    - Pre-downloading data or providing fallbacks is essential.
    - Environment variables alone may not solve NLTK download issues.

3.  **Heroku Deployment**
    - Heroku's ephemeral filesystem requires special handling for data files.
    - Environment configuration is critical for successful deployment.
    - The buildpack system has limitations for complex Python applications.
    - Build cache can sometimes cause unexpected behavior with stale code.

4.  **Debugging Complex Issues:**
    - Requires iterative steps: form hypothesis, add logging/tests, deploy, analyze results.
    - Errors can occur in unexpected places (e.g., within monitoring endpoints like `/health`).
    - Silent failures require careful logging placement to understand the application's logic flow.

## Deployment Notes

The application uses Gunicorn with the following command:
```
web: PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. PYTHON_NLTK_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py wsgi:app
```

Current Python version: 3.10 (specified in `.python-version`)

**Warning:** Heroku deployment logs showed concerns about runtime.txt being deprecated. Consider updating to use .python-version file instead.
