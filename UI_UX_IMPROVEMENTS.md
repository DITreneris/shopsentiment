## Implementation Notes

### CSS Variables
The design uses CSS variables for consistent theming:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #4CAF50;
    --primary-light: #e8f5e9;
    --primary-dark: #2e7d32;
    --secondary-color: #2196F3;
    --error-color: #f44336;
    --success-color: #4CAF50;
    --warning-color: #ff9800;
    --neutral-color: #9e9e9e;
    /* ...other variables... */
}
```

### Product Cards
Products are displayed in a responsive grid with sentiment indicators:
```html
<div class="product-card">
    <div class="product-header">
        <h3 class="product-title">Product Name</h3>
        <div class="sentiment-badge positive">
            <span class="sentiment-label">Positive</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="product-meta">
        <span class="product-id">ID: 12345</span>
        <span class="review-count">5 reviews</span>
    </div>
    <div class="product-actions">
        <button class="btn btn-outline btn-sm">View Reviews</button>
        <button class="btn btn-outline btn-sm">Sentiment Analysis</button>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Authentication Modal
Authentication is handled through a non-intrusive modal:
```html
<div class="modal-overlay" id="auth-modal">
    <div class="modal">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <h2>Authentication</h2>
            <button class="modal-close">&times;</button>
        </div>
        <!-- Tab navigation and forms -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### Sentiment Visualization
Sentiment is visualized through progress bars and a donut chart:
```html
<div class="sentiment-summary">
    <div class="sentiment-chart">
        <!-- Donut chart -->
    </div>
    <div class="sentiment-stats">
        <!-- Sentiment percentage bars -->
    </div>
</div>
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Filter and sort functionality for reviews
2. User profile and saved products
3. Enhanced data visualization with historical trends
4. Product comparison features
5. Social sharing capabilities

## How to Test
The UI can be tested by running a local server in the frontend directory:

```
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
