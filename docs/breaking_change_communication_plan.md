# Breaking Change Communication Plan for ShopSentiment API

*Last updated: April 18, 2025*

This document outlines ShopSentiment's strategy for communicating breaking changes to our API consumers, ensuring adequate preparation time and providing clear migration paths.

## Breaking Change Definition

For the purposes of this plan, a **breaking change** is defined as any modification to the API that may cause existing client integrations to stop functioning correctly. These include:

1. **Structural Changes**:
   - Removing an endpoint
   - Changing an endpoint's URL structure
   - Removing required parameters
   - Adding new required parameters
   - Changing parameter types or formats

2. **Behavioral Changes**:
   - Modifying response format or structure
   - Changing error codes or messages
   - Altering authentication requirements
   - Changing rate limits or quotas significantly

3. **Semantic Changes**:
   - Changing the meaning of existing fields
   - Modifying business logic in a user-visible way
   - Altering sort orders or default values

## Communication Timeline

### Major Breaking Changes

For changes that require significant client updates (new API version, authentication changes, etc.):

| Timeframe | Communication Actions |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 6+ months before | Initial announcement of planned change |
| 4 months before | Developer preview available |
| 3 months before | Implementation guidelines published |
| 2 months before | Beta version available |
| 1 month before | Final reminder with detailed migration guide |
| Change implementation | Go-live announcement |
| 1 month after | Follow-up and support outreach |

### Minor Breaking Changes

For less impactful changes contained within an API version:

| Timeframe | Communication Actions |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 3+ months before | Initial announcement of planned change |
| 2 months before | Implementation guidelines published |
| 1 month before | Reminder with migration details |
| 2 weeks before | Final reminder |
| Change implementation | Go-live announcement |

## Communication Channels

Breaking changes will be announced through multiple channels to ensure broad reach:

1. **Developer Portal**:
   - Dedicated "Breaking Changes" section
   - Banner notices on affected documentation pages
   - Detailed migration guides

2. **Email Notifications**:
   - Targeted emails to affected API consumers
   - General newsletter announcements
   - Reminder sequences for important changes

3. **In-App Notifications**:
   - Console alerts for developers
   - Usage-based notifications for affected endpoints

4. **API Responses**:
   - Warning headers in responses from affected endpoints
   - Deprecation notices in response bodies when appropriate

5. **Direct Outreach**:
   - Personal contact for high-usage customers
   - Webinars for significant changes
   - Office hours for technical support

## Message Content

All breaking change communications will include:

### Announcement Message

1. **Clear Headline**: Specific change being made
2. **Timeline**: Dates for preview, beta, and production release
3. **Impact Assessment**: Who will be affected and how
4. **Rationale**: Why the change is necessary
5. **Migration Path**: High-level overview of required updates
6. **Next Steps**: Clear call to action for developers
7. **Support Options**: How to get help with the transition

### Technical Details (in Developer Documentation)

1. **Before/After Comparison**: Clear examples of old vs. new behavior
2. **Code Samples**: Migration examples in multiple languages
3. **API Reference**: Updated documentation reflecting the changes
4. **Test Environment**: Information on how to test against the new implementation
5. **Common Errors**: Troubleshooting guide for migration issues
6. **FAQ**: Answers to common questions about the change

## Special Case: Emergency Changes

In rare cases where security vulnerabilities or critical bugs require immediate breaking changes:

1. **Notification**: Immediate notification through all available channels
2. **Explanation**: Clear description of the security issue (without exposing vulnerability details)
3. **Timeline**: Compressed but reasonable timeframe based on severity
4. **Support**: Enhanced support during the transition
5. **Follow-up**: Post-implementation review and lessons learned

## Measuring Communication Effectiveness

To ensure our breaking change communications are effective, we will track:

1. **Message Reach**: Open and click-through rates for emails
2. **Documentation Usage**: Views of migration guides and related pages
3. **Support Volume**: Number of support requests related to the change
4. **Test Environment Usage**: Activity in test environments for the new implementation
5. **Migration Success**: Percentage of clients successfully migrated by implementation date
6. **Post-Change Issues**: Number of issues reported after the change goes live
