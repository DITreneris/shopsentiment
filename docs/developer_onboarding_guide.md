ShopSentiment is a powerful platform that allows you to:

- Collect and analyze product reviews from various e-commerce platforms

Our REST API provides programmatic access to all these features, allowing you to integrate them seamlessly into your applications.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Account

Before using the ShopSentiment API, you need to create an account:

1. Visit [https://shopsentiment.com/register](https://shopsentiment.com/register)
2. Complete the registration form
3. Verify your email address
4. Log in to your account

### 2. Generate API Keys

Once logged in, generate API keys to authenticate your requests:

1. Navigate to the [Developer Portal](https://shopsentiment.com/developer)
2. Click on "API Keys" in the sidebar
3. Click "Generate New API Key"
4. Name your key (e.g., "Development", "Production")
5. Copy and securely store your API key

### 3. Make Your First Request

Let's make a simple request to verify your API access:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You should receive a response like:

```json

  "status": "active",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "message": "API is operational"
}
```

### 4. Explore the API

1. Visit [https://api.shopsentiment.com/docs](https://api.shopsentiment.com/docs)
2. Authenticate with your API key
3. Browse available endpoints
4. Try out API calls directly from the documentation

## Authentication

ShopSentiment uses Bearer Token authentication for all API requests.

### Adding Authentication to Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose your API key** in client-side code or public repositories
2. Use environment variables to store your API key in development
3. Implement proper key rotation for production environments
4. Consider using a dedicated API key for each integration

## Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you make the most of the ShopSentiment API:

### Products

Products represent items for which you collect and analyze reviews. Each product has:

- A unique identifier
- Basic information (name, brand, etc.)
- Associated reviews
- Aggregate statistics (average rating, sentiment distribution, etc.)

**Example: Retrieve a product**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/products/PRODUCT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Reviews

Reviews are individual customer feedback entries associated with products. Each review contains:

- Rating (numerical score)
- Text content
- Author information
- Date published
- Sentiment analysis results
- Extracted keywords

**Example: List reviews for a product**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/products/PRODUCT_ID/reviews" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Sentiment Analysis

ShopSentiment automatically analyzes the sentiment in reviews, providing:

- Overall sentiment label (positive, neutral, negative)
- Sentiment score (-1.0 to 1.0)
- Confidence rating
- Aspect-based sentiment breakdown

**Example: Analyze custom text**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/analyze/sentiment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "This product is amazing! Great battery life but the screen is a bit small."
  }'
```

### Feedback

The feedback system allows collection of user feedback on various entities:

- App feedback
- Product feedback
- Feature requests
- Bug reports

**Example: Submit feedback**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/feedback" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entity_type": "app",
    "entity_id": "homepage",
    "rating": 4,
    "title": "Great experience",
    "content": "The dashboard is very intuitive and easy to use."
  }'
```

### Search

ShopSentiment provides powerful search capabilities across all data:

- Full-text search of reviews and products
- Filters for ratings, dates, and sentiments
- Relevance scoring
- Fuzzy matching

**Example: Search for reviews containing specific terms**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/search/reviews?q=battery+life&min_rating=4" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive notifications when specific events occur:

- New reviews added
- Sentiment changes detected
- Scheduled reports ready
- Alert thresholds crossed

**Example: Register a webhook**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "new_review",
    "callback_url": "https://your-server.com/webhook-handler",
    "product_id": "PRODUCT_ID"
  }'
```

## Common Use Cases

Here are some popular ways to use the ShopSentiment API:

### 1. Review Monitoring Dashboard

```javascript
// Example: Fetch recent reviews with sentiment analysis
async function getRecentReviews() {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/reviews?limit=10&sort=date_desc",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
      }
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Process and display reviews
  data.results.forEach(review => {
    displayReview(review);
  });
}
```

### 2. Competitive Analysis

```javascript
// Example: Compare sentiment across competing products
async function compareSentiment(productIds) {
  const comparisons = await Promise.all(
    productIds.map(async (id) => {
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/products/${id}/sentiment`,
        {
          headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
          }
        }
      );
      
      return response.json();
    })
  );
  
  // Generate comparison chart
  createComparisonChart(comparisons);
}
```

### 3. Review Collection

```javascript
// Example: Submit a new review
async function submitReview(productId, reviewData) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/products/${productId}/reviews`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(reviewData)
    }
  );
  
  return response.json();
}
```

### 4. Alerting System

```javascript
// Example: Set up a negative sentiment alert
async function createSentimentAlert(productId, threshold) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/alerts`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        product_id: productId,
        alert_type: 'negative_sentiment',
        threshold: threshold,
        notification_method: 'email'
      })
    }
  );
  
  return response.json();
}
```

## Best Practices
