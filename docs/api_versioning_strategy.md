# API Versioning Strategy for ShopSentiment

*Last updated: April 18, 2025*

This document outlines the API versioning strategy for ShopSentiment to ensure backward compatibility, smooth transitions during API changes, and clear communication with API consumers.

## Version Scheme

ShopSentiment API will use a semantic versioning approach with URL-based version indicators:

```
https://api.shopsentiment.com/v1/reviews
```

The versioning scheme will follow these principles:

1. **Major Version (v1, v2)**: Represented in the URL path
2. **Minor Version**: Tracked internally but not exposed in the URL
3. **Patch Version**: Used for bug fixes, not exposed in the URL

## Versioning Rules

### When to Create a New Major Version

A new major version (e.g., v1 â†’ v2) will be created when:

- Breaking changes are introduced that affect the request or response format
- Significant functionality is removed or changed
- Authentication mechanisms change
- Resource paths are restructured

### When to Use a Minor Version

Minor versions will be incremented when:

- New endpoints are added
- Optional parameters are added
- Response payloads are extended with new fields
- New features are introduced that don't break backward compatibility

### When to Use a Patch Version

Patch versions will be used for:

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Security updates that don't affect the API interface

## Version Support Policy

### Support Timeline

- **Active Support**: The current major version and one previous major version will receive full support
- **Maintenance Support**: The second previous major version will receive security updates only
- **End of Life**: Versions older than the third most recent major version will be deprecated

### Support Duration

Each major API version will be supported for a minimum of:

- **Active Support**: 12 months after the release of the next major version
- **Maintenance Support**: 6 months after moving from active to maintenance
- **Total Minimum Support**: 18 months from initial release

## Version Management in Code

### Code Organization

API versioning will be reflected in the codebase structure:

```
app/
  api/
    v1/
      routes/
      models/
      serializers/
    v2/
      routes/
      models/
      serializers/
```

### Implementation Approach

1. **Route Handling**:
   - Each version will have its own Blueprint in Flask
   - URL patterns will include version number: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`, etc.

2. **Model Compatibility**:
   - Data models will be versioned as needed
   - Backward compatibility layers will be added for data conversion

3. **Documentation**:
   - Each API version will have its own documentation
   - Clear migration guides will be provided between versions

## Version Transition Strategy

### Announcing New Versions

1. **Developer Preview**: 
   - Released 2 months before official release
   - Available for testing with clear "not for production" warnings
   - Developer feedback collected and addressed

2. **Beta Release**:
   - Available 1 month before official release
   - Feature complete but may have known issues
   - Limited production use allowed

3. **General Availability**:
   - Official release for production use
   - Full documentation and support available

### Deprecation Process

1. **Announcement Phase**:
   - Deprecation announced at least 6 months before removal
   - Clear migration guides provided
   - Deprecation warnings added to API responses

2. **Sunset Phase**:
   - Version enters maintenance-only mode
   - Only critical security fixes applied
   - Additional deprecation warnings added

3. **Removal Phase**:
   - Version completely removed
   - Requests return appropriate error response
   - Documentation archived but still accessible

## Version Communication

### Documentation

- Each version will have separate documentation
- Version differences will be clearly highlighted
- Migration guides will be provided for each major version transition

### API Response Headers

All API responses will include version information in headers:

```
X-API-Version: 1.3.2
X-API-Deprecated: false
X-API-Sunset-Date: null
```

For deprecated versions:

```
X-API-Version: 1.3.2
X-API-Deprecated: true
X-API-Sunset-Date: 2025-09-30
X-API-Migration-Guide: https://api.shopsentiment.com/docs/migration/v1-to-v2
```

## Testing Strategy

### Compatibility Testing

- Automated tests will verify backward compatibility between minor versions
- Integration tests will validate that clients using old versions still work
- Performance tests will ensure versioning overhead is minimal

### Cross-Version Testing

- Test suites will run against all supported API versions
- Regression testing across versions will be automated
- Migration paths will be tested regularly

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Setup

1. Implement URL-based versioning in the Flask application
2. Reorganize code to support multiple versions
3. Update API documentation to include version information
4. Create version header middleware

### Phase 2: Version Management Tools

1. Implement deprecation warning system
2. Create API version monitoring dashboard
3. Develop client libraries with version support
4. Build automated version compatibility tests

### Phase 3: Documentation and Guidelines

1. Create detailed developer guides for version transitions
2. Document internal processes for version management
3. Create templates for version migration guides
4. Establish version support and communication policies

## Conclusion

This versioning strategy aims to provide a balance between innovation and stability for the ShopSentiment API. By clearly communicating changes, providing adequate transition periods, and maintaining backward compatibility where possible, we can evolve the API while minimizing disruption for our users.
