# API Deprecation Policy for ShopSentiment

*Last updated: April 18, 2025*

This document outlines ShopSentiment's policy for deprecating API features, endpoints, and versions to ensure a smooth transition for API consumers while enabling ongoing platform evolution.

## Deprecation Principles

ShopSentiment's API deprecation policy is guided by the following principles:

1. **Transparency**: All deprecations will be clearly communicated with sufficient advance notice
2. **Predictability**: Deprecation schedules will follow consistent timelines
3. **Support**: Migration assistance will be provided for all deprecated features
4. **Minimized Disruption**: Deprecations will be managed to minimize impact on users

## Deprecation Timeline

### Major API Versions

| Phase | Duration | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Active Support | At least 12 months after new version release | Full support, bug fixes, security updates |
| Maintenance | 6 months | Security updates only |
| Deprecated | 3 months | Warning notices, no updates |
| Removed | After deprecation period | Endpoint returns 410 Gone |

### Individual Endpoints or Features

| Phase | Duration | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Notice | At least 6 months before removal | Documentation updated, deprecation headers added |
| Deprecated | 3 months | Warning responses, error logs for usage |
| Removed | After deprecation period | Endpoint returns 410 Gone |

## Communication Process

### Announcement Channels

Deprecations will be announced through multiple channels:

1. **Developer Portal**: Primary source of deprecation information
2. **Email Notifications**: Sent to registered API users
3. **API Response Headers**: Runtime indicators of deprecation status
4. **Release Notes**: Detailed information with each release
5. **Status Page**: Timeline of upcoming deprecations

### Notification Content

Each deprecation announcement will include:

- The specific API, endpoint, or feature being deprecated
- The timeline for deprecation and removal
- The reason for deprecation
- Alternative solutions and migration paths
- Links to relevant documentation
- Contact information for support

## Runtime Indicators

### Response Headers

All API responses will include deprecation status in headers:

```
X-API-Version: 1.3.2
X-API-Deprecated: true
X-API-Sunset-Date: 2025-09-30
X-API-Migration-Guide: https://api.shopsentiment.com/docs/migration/feature-x
```

### Response Body

For deprecated endpoints, the response will include a deprecation notice in the body:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "deprecated": true,
    "sunset_date": "2025-09-30",
    "migration_guide": "https://api.shopsentiment.com/docs/migration/feature-x",
    "message": "This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on September 30, 2025. Please see the migration guide for alternatives."
  }
}
```

## Migration Support

### Documentation

For each deprecated feature, we will provide:

1. **Migration Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for transitioning to alternatives
2. **Code Examples**: Sample code in multiple languages showing how to update implementations
3. **Comparison Tables**: Clear documentation of differences between old and new implementations

### Support Resources

To assist with migrations, we offer:

1. **Extended Support Options**: For enterprise customers with complex integration needs
2. **Migration Tools**: Where possible, tools to automate or assist with migrations
3. **Office Hours**: Scheduled sessions for migration-related questions
4. **Dedicated Support**: Priority support for migration-related issues

## Special Circumstances

### Emergency Deprecations

In rare cases involving critical security issues or regulatory requirements, expedited deprecation may be necessary:

1. **Notification**: Immediate notification through all available channels
2. **Timeline**: Minimum 30-day notice when possible
3. **Support**: Enhanced support during the expedited transition
4. **Alternatives**: Clearly identified secure alternatives

### Extended Support

For certain critical features, extended support options may be available:

1. **Enterprise Support**: Available to enterprise customers for an additional fee
2. **Custom Timeline**: Negotiated support periods for special circumstances
3. **Transition Services**: Assisted migration for complex implementations

## Implementation Process

### Deprecation Tagging

Code for deprecated features will be clearly marked:

```python
@deprecated(
    reason="Replaced by v2 sentiment analysis endpoint",
    alternative="/api/v2/sentiment",
    sunset_date="2025-09-30"
)
def analyze_sentiment_v1():
    # Implementation...
```

### Monitoring and Reporting

We will track usage of deprecated features to:

1. Identify users still relying on deprecated functionality
2. Provide targeted communication to affected users
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of migration resources
4. Make informed decisions about support extensions if needed

### Internal Processes

Our engineering team follows these procedures for handling deprecations:

1. **Approval Process**: All deprecations require product management review
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assessment of user impact before deprecation announcement
3. **Automated Testing**: Verification that alternatives meet all use cases
4. **Documentation Review**: Quality check of migration resources

## Governance

The API deprecation policy is overseen by:

- **API Governance Committee**: Reviews and approves all deprecation plans
- **Developer Relations**: Manages communication with developers
- **Product Management**: Ensures business continuity for customers
- **Engineering**: Implements technical aspects of deprecation

## Example Deprecation Timeline

For illustrating the process, here's an example timeline for deprecating a major API version:

1. **Month 0**: New API version v2 released
2. **Month 2**: Initial announcement of v1 future deprecation
3. **Month 6**: Migration guides and tools released
4. **Month 9**: Reminder notifications sent
5. **Month 12**: v1 enters maintenance mode (security fixes only)
6. **Month 15**: Final notice, no more updates
7. **Month 18**: v1 endpoints return 410 Gone responses

## Conclusion

This deprecation policy is designed to balance ShopSentiment's need to evolve the platform with our commitment to provide a stable and reliable API for our users. By following these guidelines, we aim to make necessary transitions as smooth and predictable as possible.
