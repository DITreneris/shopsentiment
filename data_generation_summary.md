# Data Generation and Validation Summary

## Accomplished Tasks

### 1. Data Generation
- Created and improved a synthetic data generation script that successfully:
  - Generated 1,000 products with realistic metadata
  - Generated 99,586 reviews with proper sentiment analysis
  - Implemented proper MongoDB indexing for performance
  - Added proper error handling and batch processing
  - Included price formatting with currency symbols
  - Fixed data type issues (numpy.int32 conversion)

### 2. Data Validation
- Validated data consistency:
  - Confirmed all products and reviews were properly inserted
  - Verified data structure and relationships
  - Checked proper sentiment distribution (60% positive, 20% neutral, 20% negative)
- Verified index usage:
  - Confirmed product indexes on _id, platform/platform_id, created_by, created_at
  - Confirmed review indexes on _id, product_id, sentiment.label, rating, date
- Tested query performance:
  - Basic queries complete in <50ms
  - Aggregation queries process ~100K records in ~150ms
  - All queries show good performance characteristics

## Next Steps

### 1. Locust Test Configuration
- Set up Locust for load testing
- Create test scenarios for API endpoints
- Configure test parameters

### 2. MongoDB Aggregation Optimization
- Analyze slow queries
- Implement pre-computed statistics collections
- Optimize aggregation pipelines

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Set up MongoDB connection pool monitoring
- Implement Redis memory usage monitoring
- Configure Celery worker queue monitoring

## Notes
- Data generation process is now robust and scalable
- MongoDB Atlas connection is working well
- Current query performance provides a good baseline
- Data distribution includes appropriate sentiment ranges for analysis
